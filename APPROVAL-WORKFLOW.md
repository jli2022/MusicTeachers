# Registration Approval Workflow - Implementation Complete

**Feature**: Spec.Features.md Point 13 - "Approve registrations"  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and deployed to production  
**Date**: August 14, 2025

## 🎯 **Overview**

Complete registration approval system allowing admins to approve/reject teacher registrations before they can access the platform.

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Changes**
```sql
-- New enum for approval status
CREATE TYPE "ApprovalStatus" AS ENUM ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED');

-- Extended User model
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN:
- approvalStatus ApprovalStatus DEFAULT 'PENDING'
- approvedBy String? (admin who made decision)
- approvalDate DateTime? (when decision was made)  
- rejectionReason String? (reason for rejection)
```

### **Key Files Modified**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema with approval fields
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin approval interface
- `src/app/api/admin/approve/route.ts` - Approval API endpoint
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication with approval checks
- `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions

## 🔄 **Approval Workflow**

### **1. User Registration**
- New users sign up via `/auth/signup`
- Status automatically set to `PENDING`
- Teacher profile created but login blocked
- User sees: "Registration pending approval by administrator"

### **2. Admin Management**
- Admin logs into `/admin` dashboard
- **Dashboard Statistics**: Real-time counts of pending/approved/rejected users
- **Visual Indicators**: Yellow highlight for pending users
- **Pending users appear first** in sorted list for immediate attention

### **3. Admin Actions**
**Approve User:**
- One-click ✓ button for pending users
- Updates status to `APPROVED` with timestamp
- Records approving admin in `approvedBy` field
- User can immediately log in

**Reject User:**
- Click ✗ button opens rejection modal
- **Required rejection reason** field
- Updates status to `REJECTED` with reason and timestamp
- User sees rejection reason on login attempt

### **4. User Login Experience**
**PENDING Status:**
```
"Your account is pending approval. Please wait for administrator approval."
```

**REJECTED Status:**  
```
"Your account registration has been rejected. Please contact an administrator."
```

**APPROVED Status:**
- Normal login process continues
- Full platform access granted

## 🎨 **Admin Interface Features**

### **Dashboard Statistics Cards**
- 🟡 **Pending**: Count + "Awaiting approval"
- 🟢 **Approved**: Count + "Active users"  
- 🔴 **Rejected**: Count + "Declined registration"
- 🔵 **Total**: Count + "All users"

### **User List Enhancements**
- **Pending users highlighted** with yellow background and left border
- **Status badges** for all users (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED)
- **Approval action buttons** (✓ ✗) for pending users only
- **Rejection reasons displayed** for rejected users
- **Sorted display**: Pending users first, then by creation date

### **Rejection Modal**
- Required reason text area with placeholder examples
- Character validation and helpful messaging
- Cancel/confirm actions with proper state management

## 🔐 **Security & Validation**

### **Authentication Layer**
- **Login blocked** for PENDING and REJECTED users at auth level
- **JWT tokens include** approval status for session management
- **Server-side validation** prevents bypassing approval checks

### **API Security**
- **Admin-only endpoints** with role validation
- **Approval actions logged** with admin ID and timestamp
- **Input validation** for rejection reasons and user IDs

## 🧪 **Test Users (Ready for Production)**

```javascript
// Test accounts for approval workflow demonstration
const testUsers = [
  {
    email: 'pending.teacher@test.com',
    password: 'pending123',
    status: 'PENDING',
    description: 'Awaiting admin approval'
  },
  {
    email: 'rejected.teacher@test.com', 
    password: 'rejected123',
    status: 'REJECTED',
    reason: 'Incomplete WWC documentation',
    description: 'Example rejection with reason'
  },
  {
    email: 'admin@musicteachers.com',
    password: 'admin123', 
    role: 'ADMIN',
    description: 'Use this account to manage approvals'
  }
]
```
